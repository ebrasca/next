   make next                Create Next.
   make install-next        Install Next.

   make all                 Create Next.
   make install             Install Next.

on your system.  You may have to accomodate the LISP_FLAGS
to, use your local install of Quicklisp.  For example:

make next NEXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP=false LISP_FLAGS=
